		<h1>Chris Calger</h1>
		<img src="me.jpg" id="me"/>
		<p>I am a second year master's student studying mathematics at Wake Forest University. My current research interests are number theory and arithmetic geometry. I am also interested in algebraic geometry.</p>
		<p>I am currently working on a thesis, advised by <a href="https://users.wfu.edu/bourdoam/index.html">Abbey Bourdon</a>, which examines isolated points on modular curves.</p>
		<p>In 2023, I graduated from Colby College with an A.B. in Mathematics with Honors. I wrote an expository paper on elliptic curves over finite fields advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/changningphaabi">Changningphaabi Namoijam</a>.</p>
